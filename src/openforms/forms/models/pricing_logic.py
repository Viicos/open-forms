class FormPriceLogic(models.Model):
    """
    This class is deprecated in favor of form logic + variables.

    Express dynamic pricing using form logic.

    By default, prices are encapsulated in :class:`openforms.products.models.Product`,
    but certain form conditions can lead to modified prices.

    We leverage json-logic rules to evaluate conditions and specify prices when a
    condition evaluates to ``True``.

    The data model is similar to :class:`openforms.forms.models.FormLogic`.

    .. todo::

       Document logic evaluation - rules are evaluated and as soon as one matches,
       that's the winner. If multiple rules match, the first one wins.

    .. todo::

       Support complex conditions (AND/OR them together). This is a broader logic
       editing/evaluation issue that applies for regular form logic too.
