"""
Open Forms configuration and wrapper around ``vcr.py``.

There are essentially two approaches for testing the interaction with third party
services:

* Mocking the requests using ``requests_mock``
* Recording the real interactions and replaying those during tests

The tooling here assists with the second approach.

**Advantages of this approach**

- no bugs/mistakes in mock data/setup, as you are talking to a real service
- no need to manually update mocks or create them, you can automatically (re-)record
  the interactions
- if/when the remote service changes, you just run the same tests again while
  re-recording to capture the new behaviour

**Disadvantages**

- you need access to a real implementation and sharing those credentials in an open
  source project is a challenge
- there is a risk of exposing data you didn't mean to expose

**Strategies to avoid leaking information**

The host/domain of a particular service provided by a client to test with should not be
exposed, as these are internal domains. You can use `mitmproxy`_ to hide this, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    mitmdump --mode reverse:https://example.com --ssl-insecure

**Specifying the record mode**

You can set the environment variable ``VCR_RECORD_MODE`` to any of the supported
`record modes`_.
