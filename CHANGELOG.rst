2.0.0 "Règâh" (2022-10-26)
==========================

*The symbol of The Hague is the stork, a majestic bird, which is somewhat
disrespectfully called a Règâh, or heron, by the residents of The Hague.*

BEFORE upgrading to 2.0.0, please read the release notes carefully.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

Open Forms 2.0.0 contains a number of breaking changes. While we aim to make the upgrade
process as smooth as possible, you will have to perform some manual actions to ensure
this process works correctly.

1. You must first upgrade to (at least) version 1.1.6

   .. warning::
      This ensures that all the relevant database changes are applied before
      the changes for 2.0 are applied. Failing to do so may result in data loss.

2. Ensure that there are no duplicate component keys in your forms.

   After upgrading to 1.1.6, run the ``check_duplicate_component_keys`` management
   command, which will report the forms that have non-unique component keys:

   .. code-block:: bash

       # in the container via ``docker exec`` or ``kubectl exec``:
       python src/manage.py check_duplicate_component_keys

   If there are duplicate component keys, you must edit the forms via the admin
   interface to rename them.

3. Next, you must ensure that all component keys are *valid* keys - keys may only
   contains letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens and periods. Additionally, keys may not
   end with a period or hyphen.

   .. code-block:: bash

       # in the container via ``docker exec`` or ``kubectl exec``:
       python src/manage.py check_invalid_field_keys

   Any invalid keys will be reported, and you must edit the forms via the admin
   interface to change them.

4. After resolving any problems reported from the commands/scripts above, you can
   proceed to upgrade to version 2.0.0

Changes
-------

**Breaking changes**

We always try to minimize the impact of breaking changes, especially with automated
upgrade processes. However, we cannot predict all edge cases, so we advise you to
double check with the list of breaking changes in mind.

* Introduced form variables in the engine core. Existing forms are automatically
  migrated and should continue to work.
* Component keys must be unique within a single form. This used to be a warning, it is
  now an error.
* The logic action type ``value`` has been replaced with setting the value of a
  variable. There is an automatic migration to update existing forms.
* Removed the ``Submission.bsn``, ``Submission.kvk`` and ``Submission.pseudo`` fields.
  These have been replaced with the ``authentication.AuthInfo`` model.
* The major API version is now ``/api/v2`` and the ``/api/v1`` endpoints have been
  replaced. For non-deprecated endpoints, you can simply replace ``v1`` with ``v2`` in
  your own configuration.
* The logic rules (form logic, price logic) endpoints have been removed in favour of
  the new bulk endpoints
* The logic action type 'value' has been replaced with action type 'variable'. There is
  an automatic migration to update existing forms.
* The Design tokens to theme Open Forms have been renamed. There is an automatic
  migration to update your configuration.
* Before 1.2.0, the SDK would display a hardcoded message to start the form depending on
  the authentication options. This is removed and you need to use the form explanation
  WYSIWYG field to add the text for end-users.
* The ``DELETE /api/v1/authentication/session`` endpoint was removed, instead use the
  submission specific endpoint.
* Advanced logic in certain components (like fieldsets) has been removed - conditional
  hide/display other than JSON-logic/simple logic is no longer supported.
* Enabled Cross-Site-Request-Forgery protections for *anonymous* users (read: non-staff
  users filling out forms). Ensure that your Open Forms Client sends the CSRF Token
  value received from the backend. Additionally, for embedded forms you must ensure
  that the ``Referer`` request header is sent in cross-origin requests. You will likely
  have to tweak the ``Referrer-Policy`` response header.

**New features/improvements**

*Core*

* [#1325] Introduced the concept of "form variables", enabling a greater flexibility
  for form designers

  * Every form field is automatically a form variable
  * Defined a number of always-available static variables (such as the current
    timestamp, form name and ID, environment, authentication details...)
  * Form designers can define their own "user-defined variables" to use in logic and
    calculations
  * Added API endpoints to read/set form variables in bulk
  * Added API endpoint to list the static variables
  * The static variables interface is extensible

* [#1546] Reworked form logic rules

  * Rules now have explicit ordering, which you can modify in the UI
  * You can now specify that a rule should only be evaluated from a particular form
    step onwards (instead of 'always')
  * Form rules are now explicitely listed in the admin for debugging purposes
  * Improved display of JSON-logic expressions in the form designer
  * When adding a logic rule, you can now pick between simple or advanced - more types
    will be added in the future, such as DMN.
  * You can now use all form variables in logic rules

* [#1708] Reworked the logic evaluation for a submission

  * Implemented isolated/sandboxed template environment
  * Form components now support template expressions using the form variables
  * The evaluation flow is now more deterministic: first all rules are evaluated that
    updated values of variables, then all other logic actions are evaluated using
    those variable values

* [#1661] Submission authentication is now tracked differently

  * Removed the authentication identifier fields on the ``Submission`` model
  * Added a new, generic model to track authentication information:
    ``authentication.AuthInfo``
  * Exposed the submission authentication details as static form variables - you now
    no longer need to add hidden form fields to access this information.

* [#1967] Reworked form publishing tools

  * Deactivated forms are deactivated for everyone
  * Forms in maintenance mode are not available, unless you're a staff member
  * The API endpoints now return HTTP 422 or HTTP 503 errors when a form is deactivated
    or in maintenance mode
  * [#2014] Documented the recommended workflows

* [#1682] Logic rules evaluation is now logged with the available context. This should
  help in debugging your form logic.
* [#1616] Define extra CSP directives in the admin
* [#1680] Laid the groundwork for DMN engine support. Note that this is not exposed
  anywhere yet, but this will come in the future.
* [#1687] There is now an explicit validate endpoint for submisisons and possible error
  responses are documented in the API spec.
* [#1739] (API) endpoints now emit headers to prevent browser caching
* [#1719] Submission reports can now be downloaded for a limited time instead of only once
* [#1835] Added bulk endpoints for form and price logic rules
* [#1944] API responses now include more headers to expose staff-only functionality to
  the SDK, and permissions are now checked to block/allow navigating between form
  steps without the previous steps being completed.
* [#1922] First passes at profiling and optimizing the API endpoints performance
* Enabled Cross-Site-Request-Forgery protections for *anonymous* users
* [#2042] Various performance improvements

*Form designer*

* [#1642] Forms can now be assigned to categories in a folder structure
* [#1710] Added "repeating group" functionality/component
* [#1878] Added more validation options for date components

  * Specify a fixed min or max date; or
  * Specify a minimum date in the future; or
  * Specify a maximum date in the past; or
  * Specify a min/max date relative to a form variable

* [#1921] You can now specify a global default for allowed file types
* [#1621] The save/save-and-continue buttons are now always visible on the page in
  large forms
* [#1651] Added 'Show Form' button on form admin page
* [#1643] There is now a default maximum amount of characters (1000) for text areas
* [#1325] Added management command to check number of forms with duplicate component keys
* [#1611] Improved the UX when saving a form which still has validation errors somewhere.
* [#1771] When a form step is deleted and the form definition is not reusable, the form
  definition is now deleted as well
* [#1702] Added validation for re-usable form definitions - you can no longer mark a
  form definition as not-reusable if it's used in multiple forms
* [#1708] We now keep track of the number of formio components used in a form step for
  statistical/performance analysis
* [#1806] Ensure that logic variable references are updated
* [#1933] Replaced hardcoded SDK start (login) message with text in form explanation
  template.
* [#2078] field labels are now compulsory (a11y)
* [#2124] Added message to file-upload component informing the user of the maximum
  allowed file upload size.
* [#2113] added option to control column size on mobile viewports
* [#1351] Allow negative currency and number components

* [#1769] StUF-ZDS: you can now specify the ``vertrouwelijkheidaanduiding``
* [#1183] Intermediate registration results are now properly tracked and re-used,
  preventing the same objects being created over and over again if registration is being
  retried. This especially affects StUF-ZDS and ZGW API's registration backends.
* [#1877] Registration e-mail subject is now configurable
* [#1867] StUF-ZDS & ZGW: Added more registration fields

*Prefill*

* [#1693] Added normalization of the postcode format according to the specified
  comonent mask

1.1.2 (2022-06-16)
==================

Hotfix following 1.1.1

The patch validating uploaded file content types did not anticipate the explicit
wildcard configuration option in Formio to allow all file types. This caused files
uploaded by end-users to not be attached to the submission.

We've fixed the wildcard behaviour, but you should check your instances for incomplete
data. This involves a couple of steps with some pointers below.

1. The temporary uploads are automatically removed by the cronjobs at 3:30 UTC. The
   default setting is to do this after 2 days (48 hours). We have provided an example
   `management command <https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/blob/issue/recover-missing-submission-attachments/src/openforms/utils/management/commands/check_restore_needed.py>`_ that you can use to check if you need to partially
   restore backups. Make sure to tweak the ``WINDOW_START`` and ``WINDOW_END`` variables
   to your specific situation - the start would be when you started deploying version
   1.0.9, and the end would be ``most recent 3:30 minus 48 hours``.

2. If you need to do partial restores, you should recover the records from the
   ``submissions_temporaryfileupload`` database table where the ``created_on`` timestamp
   lies in your interval. Additionally, you need to recover the file uploads of those
   relevant records. The paths are given by the column ``content``. You find those files
   in the ``private_media`` directory.

3. Finally, you can run the management command ``recover_missing_attachments``, which
   will report any issues and print out the references and IDs of the affected
   submissions.

1.0.10 (2022-06-16)
===================

Hotfix following 1.0.9 - this is the same patch as 1.1.2.

1.1.1 (2022-06-13)
==================

Security release (CVE-2022-31040, CVE-2022-31041)

This bugfix release fixes two security issues in Open Forms. We recommend upgrading
as soon as possible.

* [CVE-2022-31040] Fixed open redirect in cookie-consent 'close' button
* [CVE-2022-31041] Perform upload content validation against allowed file types
* [#1670] Update error message for number validation

1.0.9 (2022-06-13)
==================

Security release (CVE-2022-31040, CVE-2022-31041)

This bugfix release fixes two security issues in Open Forms. We recommend upgrading
as soon as possible.

* [CVE-2022-31040] Fixed open redirect in cookie-consent 'close' button
* [CVE-2022-31041] Perform upload content validation against allowed file types
* [#1670] Update error message for number validation
* [#1560] Fix prefill not working inside of nested/layout components

1.1.0 (2022-05-24)
==================

Feature release 1.1.0

For the full list of changes, please review the changelog entries below for 1.1.0-rc.0
and 1.1.0-rc.1.

Since 1.1.0-rc.1, the following changes were made:

* Fixed maintaining the logo aspect ratio in the confirmation PDF for a submission
* Exposed options to display content/WYSIWYG text in confirmation emails
* WYSIWYG component content is displayed full-width in the confirmation email and PDF

1.1.0-rc.1 (2022-05-20)
=======================

Second release candidate for the 1.1.0 feature release.

* [#1624] Fixed list of prefill attributes refresh on prefill plugin change
* Fixed styling issue with card components in non-admin pages
* [#1628] Make fieldset labels stand out in emails
* [#1628] Made styling of registration email consistent with confirmation email
* Added raw_id_fields to submissions admin for a performance boost
* [#1627] Fixed CSRF error when authenticating in the admin after starting a form
* Fixed cookie ``SameSite=None`` being used in non-HTTPS context for dev environments
* [#1628] Added missing form designer translations for display/summary options
* [#1628] Added vertical spacing to confirmation PDF pages other than the first page

.. note:: #1627 caused session authentication to no longer be available in the API
   schema for the submission suspend/complete endpoints. This was not intended to be
   public API, so this option is gone now.

   Both of these endpoints require a valid submission ID to exist in the session to
   use them, which was the intended behaviour.

1.1.0-rc.0 (2022-05-17)
=======================

First release candidate of the 1.1.x release series!

Version 1.1.0 contains a number of improvements, both in the backend and SDK. All
changes are backwards compatible, but some features have been deprecated and will be
removed in version 2.0, see the last section of this changelog entry.

**Summary**

* The API spec has been bumped to version 1.1.0
* A new minor version of the SDK is available, which requires a minimum backend version
  of 1.1.0
* Upgrading should be straigh-forward - no manual interventions are needed.

**New features**

* [#1418] Expose ``Submission.isAuthenticated`` in the API
* [#1404] Added configuration options for required fields

  - Configure whether fields should be marked as required by default or not
  - Configure if an asterisk should be used for required fields or not

* [#565] Added support for DigiD/eHerkenning via OpenID Connect protocol
* [#1420] Links created by the form-builder now always open in a new window (by default)
* [#1358] Added support for Mutual TLS (mTLS) in service configuration - you can now
  upload client/server certificates and relate them to JSON/SOAP services.
* [#1495] Reworked admin interface to configure mTLS for SOAP services
* [#1436] Expose ``Form.submissionAllowed`` as public field in the API
* [#1441] Added submission-specific user logout endpoint to the API. This now clears the
  session for the particular form only, leaving other form session untouched. For
  authenticated staff users, this no longer logs you out from the admin interface. The
  existing endpoint is deprecated.
* [#1449] Added option to specify maximum number of files for file uploads
* [#1452] Added option to specify a validation regular-expression on telefone field
* [#1452] Added phone-number validators to API for extensive validation
* [#1313] Added option to auto redirect to selected auth backend
* [#1476] Added readonly option to BSN, date and postcode components
* [#1472] Improved logic validation error feedback in the form builder
* [#1482, #1510] Added bulk export and import of forms functionality to the admin interface
* [#1483] Added support for dark browser theme
* [#1471] Added support for DigiD Machtigen and eHerkenning Bewindvoering with OIDC
* [#1453] Added Formio specific file-upload endpoint, as it expects a particular
  response format for success/failure respones. The existing endpoint is deprecated.
* [#1540] Removed "API" and "layout" tabs for the content component.
* [#1544] Improved overview of different components in the logic rule editor.
* [#1541] Allow some NL Design System compatible custom CSS classes for the content
  component.
* [#1451] Completely overhauled "submission rendering". Submission rendering is used
  to generate the confirmation e-mails, PDFs, registration e-mails, exports...

  - You can now specify whether a component should be displayed in different modes
    (PDF, summary, confirmation e-mail)
  - Implemented sane defaults for configuration options
  - PDF / Confirmation e-mails / registration e-mails now have more structure,
    including form step titles
  - Container elements (fieldsets, columns, steps) are only rendered if they have
    visible content
  - Logic is now respected to determine which elements are visible or hidden
  - Added a CLI render mode for debug/testing purposes
  - Fixed page numbers being half-visible in the confirmation PDF

* [#1458] Submission registration attempts are now limited to a configurable upper
  bound. After this is reached, there will be no automatic retries anymore, but manual
  retries via the admin interface are still possible.
* [#1584] Use the original filename when downloading submission attachments
* [#1308] The admin interface now displays warnings and proper error messages if your
  session is about to expire or has expired. When the session is about to expire, you
  can extend it so you can keep working for longer times in the UI.

**Bugfixes**

All the bugfixes up to the ``1.0.8`` release are included.

* [#1422] Prevent update of custom keys on label changes for radio button components
  in the form builder
